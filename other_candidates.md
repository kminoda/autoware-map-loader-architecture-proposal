# Other architecture candidates
## Area-query, area-response
One of the other architectures we had in mind is this. 


### Pros
- Simple

### Cons
- Requires high computational complexity algorithm for extracting points within the designated area

## Area-query, grids-response
![Candidate architecture 1](./figures/candidate_architecture_2.drawio.svg)

### Pros
- Fairly simple
- 

### Cons
- Still cannot support differential area loading ()
